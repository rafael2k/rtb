Gordon Henderson's “Return to Basic” interpreter — GPL 3 version of 2013-01-27

Gordon no longer provides source for his interpreter, so this is an
archive of the last known GPL version retrieved from his server. Many
thanks to John of the
[allbasic.info](http://www.allbasic.info/forum/index.php?topic=223.msg4768#msg4768
"allbasic.info") forum for providing the files.

**NB**: As supplied, this package does *not* build on a Raspberry
Pi. At the very least, it will need CMake and SDL installed.
