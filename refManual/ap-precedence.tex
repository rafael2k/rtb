\index{Operator Precedence}

When evaluating expressions, RTB performs things in a certain order,
and this order may not be immediately obvious. The reasons for the order
here are long and complex, but mostly ``because that's how most other
systems do it''.

When changing programming language, it's always wise to find out what its
operator precedence rules are - and when in doubt, (use brackets).
